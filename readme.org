#+title: DASK Weak scaling evaluation
#+author: Isac Pasianotto


This repository contains code designed to evaluate the weak scaling performance of the [[https://www.dask.org][Dask]] distributed computing library.
The primary purpose of this project is to provide a means to compare the performance of a Dask cluster's installation and find out how different configurations affect the scalability of the system.

The scalability is expressed in terms of [[https://hpc-wiki.info/hpc/Scaling][weak scaling]], which measures the efficiency of a parallel algorithm when the problem size and the number of computational resources are increased proportionally.

In particular the code in this repository was originally developed to compare the performance of a Dask cluster installed on a HPC cluster based on the [[https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html][Slurm]] workload manager and the installation on the same hardware but using the [[https://kubernetes.io/][Kubernetes]] container orchestration system.
However the code should be easily adaptable to other distributed computing environments, for more detail see the [[https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/deploying.html][Dask documentation]] related to deploying Dask on different environments.


* Get stared

All the code in this repository was tested using ~python 3.11.3~.

To get started, just clone this repository, create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/IsacPasianotto/dask-bench
cd dask-bench
python -m venv daskbenchenv
source daskbenchenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

And then /remember to adjust the/ [[.env][.env]] file to match your configuration.

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
*Remark* Slurm uses ~GB~ as the default unit for memory, while Kubernetes uses ~Gi~. Take it into account when setting the memory limits in the ~.env~ file.
#+END_COMMENT


** Get starded -  Kubernetes

Despite being a very flexible tools, Dask is also very rigorous in ensuring that the scheduler, the worker and in the case of Kubernetes also the client have the same version of every package installed.

Despite [[https://github.com/dask/dask-docker][official images]] are available, packages in them may not be always alligned with the installed version of Dask in the client.
For this reason it's recommended to build the images locally (maybe pushing it also to a private registry) and then use it.

To do so the provided [[Dockerfile][Dockerfile]] can be used.


* Usage

TBD  ...
